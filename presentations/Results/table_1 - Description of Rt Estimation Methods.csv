Ratio Model,"$R_t$ is the sum of new cases ($I$) within a time window (size $\tau$) centered on day $t + D$ divided by the sum of new cases on a time window centered on day $t$, where $D$ is the mean generation interval.",$$R_t = \frac{\sum_{i = t - \frac{\tau}{2} + D}^{t + \frac{\tau}{2} + D}I_i}{\sum_{i = t - \frac{\tau}{2}}^{t + \frac{\tau}{2}}I_i}$$,NA
Cori (2013),"$R_t$ is calculated as the number of new cases ($I$) within a time window (size $\tau$) centered on day $t$ divided by the sum of infectiousness of all individual infected prior to the time window, where infectiousness is defined by the probability distribution of the generation interval",$$R_t = \frac{\sum_{i = t -\frac{\tau}{2}}^{t+\frac{\tau}{2}}I_i}{\sum_{i = 0}^{t -\frac{\tau}{2}}I_i*w(i)}$$,Modified from [@coriNewFrameworkSoftware2013]
Walinga & Teunis (2004),"For this method, all transmission networks compatible with the observed number of new cases per day are considered and a pre-defined distribution of generational intervals ($w(t)$). The likelihood that a new case $i$ was infected by existing case $j$ is the probability of a generation interval equal to the time difference between $i$ and $j$ ($w(t_i - t_j)$). The relative likelihood of $i$ being infected by $j$ ($p_{ij}$) is $w(t_i - t_j)$ normalized to the likelihood of case $i$ having been infected by all other cases $k$. The likely number of cases produced by $j$ ($R_j$), is the sum of $p_{i,j}$ for all new cases $i$. Thus, $R_t$ is is the average of all $R_j$.","$$p_{i,j} = \frac{w(t_i - t_j)}{\sum_{i \neq k}{w(t_i â€“ t_k)}}$$ $$R_j = \sum_{i} p_{i,j}$$  $$R_t = \bar{R_j}$$",[@wallingaDifferentEpidemicCurves2004; @obadiaR0PackageToolbox2012]
Walinga & Lipsitch (2007),$R_t$ is derived from rate exponential growth ($r$) observed within a time window (size $\tau$) centered on day $t$,$$R_t = \frac{1}{\int_{t = 0}^{\infty} e^{-rt}w(t)dt}$$,Modified from @wallingaHowGenerationIntervals2007
