Here we show multiple methods of estimating the effective reproduction number ($R_t$) for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The R value is the the average number an infected person will infect. If the R is greater than 1, then the epidemic is growing. However, if R is less than one, the the epidemic is shrinking. The R value is influence by both biological factors (e.g. how the virus infects and spreads) as well as social factors (e.g. social distancing and masking wearing). Note that these estimates are retrospective (looking into the past) and not predictions of future rates of transmission.

Here we allow the user to estimate R by 4 different methods. All methods for estimating R depend primarily on 2 things: (1) The number of new cases per day and (2) distribution of the generation interval (i.e. the amount of time from when one person is infected to when that person infects another person). See "Code" section for information on how each estimate of R is calculated.

**Note: We have made assumptions in calculating this R values. Neither those assumptions nor the code for this tool have been peer-reviewed**
