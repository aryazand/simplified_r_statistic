Here we show multiple methods of estimating the effective reproduction number (R) for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The R value is the the average number an infected person will infect. If the R is greater than 1, then the epidemic is growing. However, if R is less than one, the the epidemic is shrinking. The R value is influence by both biological factors (e.g. how the virus infects and spreads) as well as social factors (e.g. social distancing and masking wearing). Note that our estimates here are retrospective (looking into the past). Thus, by themselves, these estimations are not prediction on the current or future state of the epidemic.

**Note: We have made assumptions in calculating this R values. Neither those assumptions or the code for this tool have been peer-reviewed**
